Add the following lines to .bashrc:

	export DY_DIRECTORY=~/dynamism-0.4.2
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DY_DIRECTORY/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	export PYTHONPATH=$DY_DIRECTORY/core/dyna-python:$PYTHONPATH

Then type "make" to build dynamism.

To use the Python interface, make sure you have installed Python 2.5 as well as numpy.  
To override the Python interface, edit dy_core.h and set:
	#define DY_PYTHON 0

For Matlab, make sure that "mex" is on your PATH.
